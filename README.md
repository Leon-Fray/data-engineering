# ðŸš• Revel Data Engineering Project

## Objective 

In this project, I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline that consists of several stages:



-Extracted data from NYC Trip Record Data website and loaded it into Google Cloud Storage for further processing.
-Transformed and modeled the data using fact and dimensional data modeling concepts using Python on Jupyter Notebook.
-Using ETL, I orchestrated the data pipeline on Mage and loaded the transformed data into Google BigQuery.
-Developed a dashboard on Looker Studio.

 
Since this is a data engineering project, my emphasis is primarily on the engineering aspect with a lesser emphasis on analytics and dashboard development.

#Dataset 

This project uses the TLC Trip Record Data which include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
